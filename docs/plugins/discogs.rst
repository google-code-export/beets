Discogs Plugin
==============

The ``discogs`` plugin extends the autotagger's search capabilities to
include matches from the `Discogs`_ database.

Installation
------------

First, enable the ``discogs`` plugin (see :doc:`/plugins/index`). Then,
install the `discogs-client`_ library by typing::

    pip install discogs-client

That's it! Matches from Discogs will now show up during import alongside
matches from MusicBrainz.
