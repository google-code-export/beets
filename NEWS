* Support for Ogg Vorbis and Monkey's Audio files and their tags.
  (This support should be considered preliminary: I haven't tested it
  heavily because I don't use either of these formats regularly.)
* Add an option to the "beet import" command for logging albums that
  are untaggable (i.e., are skipped or taken "as-is"). Use
  "beet import -l LOGFILE PATHS". The log format is very simple: it's
  just a status (either "skip" or "asis") followed by the path to the
  album in question. The idea is that you can tag a large collection
  and automatically keep track of the albums that weren't found in
  MusicBrainz so you can come back and look at them later.
* Fix UnicodeEncodeError on terminals that don't (or don't claim to)
  support UTF-8.
* Importing without autotagging ("beet import -A") is now faster and
  doesn't print out a bunch of whitespace.
* The importer now logs an error instead of crashing when it attempts
  to read a corrupt file.
